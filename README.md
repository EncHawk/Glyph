## GLYPHAI - multimodal agentic chat platform

While this was my dream of making it into the big leagues its tearing me apart, i dont seem to be making enough progress to even commit the code.
the previous version seems better than the ones that i test locally, that's a clear sign of loss. While this wont stop me from wondering what needs to change,
Glyph is no longer the priority, it is gonna be very hard for me to move away from this but i have to. 

##### With a lot of pain i shut the door on this project, very dear to me. all the code and the feedback loop can be viewed as well

note : This is definitely not the end, i will come back with a better strategy to make this work, for the time being i need rest. I need to learn new tech at the same time.

Goodbye,
Dilip,
15/02/26 (i will be back)
